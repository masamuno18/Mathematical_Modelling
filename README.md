## Description of the course_work
The python codes presented here are part of personl additional work on part of the course work in spring 2021. The course Mathematical Modelling aimed to teach the different techniques to construct mathematical models using finite difference method for different models. The model studied in the course contains
1. Population dynamics
2. Fibonacci models
3. Linear cell divison model
4. Linear difference equation with constant coefficients
5. Linear Prey-Predator model
6. Bernoulli-Lewis-Leslie model
7. Non-Linear Cell division model
8. Logistic Growth Function
9. Logistic growth in prey-predator model
10. Resource limiting prey-predator model
11. Continuous Time modelling
12. Chemostat model
13. Allee Effect Model
14. Lotka-Volterra model
15. Continuous prey-predator model

The course aimed for the theoretical view only, I did the personal work of writing the python functions for the most of the above models for self analysing the concepts of bifurcation, analysis of the parameters involved. This helped me understand the different models much more depth and understand the useage and their limitation. This also helped me in much greater understanding of formation of methematical model for different problems. 
#### Achieved a GPA 10/10 in the course.
